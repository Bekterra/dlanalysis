util.R contains utilities for R that I find useful.

There used to be lots of other stuff in this repository, but it's now obsolete,
so I removed it to prevent confusion.  Please see older revisions if you want
it.  (It's statistical Mechanical Turk quality cleanup stuff, including code
used in Snow et al 2008.  See some related stuff and code [here] [1]).
